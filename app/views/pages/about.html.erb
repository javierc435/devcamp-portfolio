    <p>With over a decade of development experience in a number of industries I realized that the typical product creation process between clients and developers was flawed. All too often developers rarely communicate to clients throughout the development stage, resulting in a final product that fails to reach the goal sought by the customer and end user.</p>

    <p>For this reason I decided to utilize a completely different development pattern that focuses on highly focused communication and transparent design patterns.</p>
